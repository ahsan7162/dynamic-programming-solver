# dynamic-programming-solver
In this system we have created a web application to show the working of 10 different dynamic programming algorithm in a very great UI.

### Live Website
[For live view](http://dynamic-solver.rf.gd/index.php?i=1)

### Problems Shown In System
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Shortest Common Supersequence
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Levienthein Distance (Edit distance)
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- 0-1 Knapsack
- Partition Problem
- Rod Cutting Problem
- Minimum Coin Change
- Word break Problem

### Features of System
- In LCS, SCS, Edit Distance problem user can enter its own string or can use pre-defined inputs
- In rest of problems user can select any of 10 pre defined inputs to see working of system
- Beautiful UI
- Input and Output in Tabular format
